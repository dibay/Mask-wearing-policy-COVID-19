# Goal of the project:
We are living in a critical era as the numbers of the new COVID_19 cases and death due to COVID-19 are increasing worldwide and in the US. So far COVID-19 cases are approximately [73 million worldwide including 16 million cases in the United States](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). [Mask wearing as part of the social distancing methods](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html) is recommended as to subside the spread of this virus. However, [twelve states in the US have very limited mask wearing requirements and South Dakota has absolutely no requirement](https://masks4all.co/what-states-require-masks/). In this project I am trying to evaluate the effect of mask wearing policy on COVID-19 burden (i.e. new cases and new deaths). To do so I will focus on the data from two neighbor states (Georgia and Alabama) with different mask wearing policies to minimize the effect of confounding factors (e.g. weather, demographics). These two states are neighbors which helps controlling for the differences in weather in addition to other factors such as ethnicity, education which are very similar for [Georgia](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/GA) and [Alabama](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/AL). Per CDC minorities are at higher risk of COVID-19 and thus it is important to make the comparison of mask mandating policies between states that are similar/close in ethnicity distribution.
