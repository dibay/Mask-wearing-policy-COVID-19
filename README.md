# Goal of the project:
We are living in a critical era as the numbers of the new COVID_19 cases and death due to COVID-19 are increasing worldwide and in the US. Mask wearing as part of the social distancing measures is recommended as to subside the spread of this virus. However, [twelve states in the US have very limited mask wearing requirements and South Dakota has absolutely no requirement](https://masks4all.co/what-states-require-masks/). In this project I am trying to evaluate the effect of mask wearing policy on COVID-19 burden. To do so I will focus on the data from two neighbor states (Georgia and Alabama) with different mask wearing policies to minimize the effect of confounding factors (e.g. weather, demographics).
