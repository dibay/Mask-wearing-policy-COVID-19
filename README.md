# Abstract:
## Introduction: We are living in a critical era as the numbers of the new COVID_19 cases and death due to COVID-19 are increasing worldwide and in the US. So far COVID-19 cases are approximately [73 million worldwide including 16 million cases in the United States](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). [Mask wearing as part of the social distancing methods](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html) is recommended as to subside the spread of this virus. However, [twelve states in the US have very limited mask wearing requirements and South Dakota has absolutely no requirement](https://masks4all.co/what-states-require-masks/). This project evaluated the effect of mask wearing policy on COVID-19 burden (i.e. new cases and new deaths). The data from two neighbor states (Georgia and Alabama) with different mask wearing policies where considered to minimize the effect of confounding factors (e.g. weather, demographics).
