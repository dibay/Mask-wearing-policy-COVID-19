# Goal of the project:
We are living in a critical era as the number of the new COVID_19 cases and death due to this lethal virus is increasing worldwide and in the US. Now COVID-19 cases is approximately [73 million worldwide including 16 million in the united states](https://github.com/https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). However, sixteen states have very limited mask wearing requirements and one state (South Dacota) has absolutely no requirement. In this project I am trying to evaluate the effect of mask policy on COVID-19 cases. To do so I will focus on the data from two neighbor states (Georgia and Alabama) with different policies tominimize the effect of other factors (e.g. weather, demographics).
